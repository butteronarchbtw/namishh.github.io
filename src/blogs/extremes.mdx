Sitting on a bench, I start to see

The unfair world god has build around me

See the kid over there, doing everything

To make sure his family eats something

Works hard in those construction site

While watching those kids flying their kites

These kids do not experience any pain

Live like kings with their personality stained

Filled with ego and arrogance alike

Playing with their toys and riding their bikes

Look at the sweeper on the other side

Working extra hard since her husband has died

Also works as a maid when the sweeping is done

To make sure in her home, hunger is with none

Oh and that is the mayor of the town

Driving an expensive limo thats brown

Does not care about the city he swore to protect

And anything that doesnt make him rich, he neglects
