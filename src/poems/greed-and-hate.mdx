Oh, this is the root of all evils,<br/>
Something that piercies more than a needle,<br/>
Something that can have consequences tomorrow,<br/>
Something that can cause a lot of sorrow<br/>
Something that can cause a war <br/>
No it is not some mere missile nor<br/>
Some puny grenade<br/>
It is something that cuts deeper than any blade<br/>
Something that turns friends into foes<br/>
And a man into a monster beofre he knows<br/>
Something that can destroy human and his creed<br/>
It is also known as the human greed <br/><br/>
Thats all about greed but wait<br/>
We cannot end here we have to talk about hate<br/>
It is something that destroys you<br/>
And reduce your relationships to few<br/>
Something that can destroy your look<br/>
Like the fearsome Blackbeard, with a sword and a hook<br/>
Something that will change your life for the worse<br/>
Something that cannot be treated by a doctor or a nurse<br/>
Overcoming hate is the hardest chore<br/>
But it will make you a better person, for sure<br/>
