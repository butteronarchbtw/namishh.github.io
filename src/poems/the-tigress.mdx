In this world deprived of viridescent trees,<br/>
Full of automobiles with metallic sheen,<br/>
Roams the last survivor of the race,<br/>
Of the ones who once, walked with grace.<br/><br/>
A coat of gold with ebony stripes,<br/>
Runs a queen with all her might,<br/>
To keep herself alive in these conditions dire,<br/>
In a planet currently burning in hot fire<br/><br/>
All her mission was to raise,<br/>
Two cubs that could potentially save<br/>
The royal race of striped carnivores<br/>
The one who hath the humans devoured<br/><br/>
She roamed in shadows, away from mankind<br/>
Whose greed and ignorance had left them blind<br/>
She used to fight with all her strength<br/>
To satisy her hungers and make the throat quenched<br/><br/>
As time went on, her strength diminished<br/>
Her old body struggled to flourish<br/>
Yet she was determined to stay<br/>
To make sure that her speices see another day<br/><br/>
When the auspicious time had arrived<br/>
A boy and a girl came out and survived<br/>
But alas, the queen herself couldn't thrive<br/>
But made sure that her race was revived<br/>
