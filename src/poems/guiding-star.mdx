In the vast woods, where trees stand tall and proud,

A lost traveller finds himself tired and bowed.

No clear way through the forest, a state of dismay,

Trapped in the heart of woods, where dead souls stray.

With no map to unfold and a compass to trust,

In the silence of night, where hope is must.

The traveller looks above with a questioning sigh,

And stares deeply into the vast, never ending sky.

He notices a sparkle, amidst the dark and cloudy sea,

The twinkling of the North Star, maybe a new possibility.

"Oh star, lead me to safety, show me a way,

So that I make it alive by the break of the day."

Uncertain about this future, he follows the star bright.

Set out with a hope, to escape his darkest night.

In the woods of the future, unkwown,

Seeds of doubt start to be sown.

With optimism as compass and faith as the guiding star,

We battle through uncertainities, no matter how bizzare.
